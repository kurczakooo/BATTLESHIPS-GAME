## BATTLESHIPS GAME
A small interactive game of battleships played against ai made for a college project. (Made in C++ and Allegro 5)

### DONE✅:
- player can randomize their ship's placement,
- the game is fully playable.

### TO DO IN THE FUTURE📝:
- give the player a possibility to rotate their ships,
- fix a bug that sometimes crashes the game when u lose (ai tries to hit a tile on the player's board after all of them have been hit).
