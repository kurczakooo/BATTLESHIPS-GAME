## BATTLESHIPS GAME
A small interactive game of battleships played against ai made for a college project. (Made in C++ and Allegro 5)

### DONE✅:
- player can randomize their ship's placement,
- the game is fully playable.

### TO DO IN THE FUTURE📝:
- give the player a possibility to rotate their ships,
- fix a bug that sometimes crashes the game when u lose (ai tries to hit a tile on the player's board after all of them have been hit).

#### ❗NOTE TO SELF: 
When making the option to rotate the ships, instead of using bool for CzyStatek variable use int, and add 1 to tiles surrounding the ship, and substract 1 when removed. This way when there will be 2 ships neighbouring the tiles between them will have WokolStatku value of 2, and based on that value mark the surrounding tiles in the gameplay and when randomizing the ships.
