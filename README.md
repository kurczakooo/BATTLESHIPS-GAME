## BATTLESHIPS GAME
A small interactive game of battleships played against ai, made for a college project. (Made in C++ and Allegro 5)

### DONE✅:
- player can randomize their ships placement,
- game is fully playable.

### TO DO IN FUTURE📝:
- give player the possibility to rotate their ships,
- fix a bug which sometimes crashes the game when u lose (ai tries to hit a tile on players board after all of them have been hit).
